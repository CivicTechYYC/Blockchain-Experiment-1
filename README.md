# Blockchain-Experiment-1
How might we help preserve an existing dataset of volunteer deeds, long after the organization that created it (or the platform that hosted it) is gone?

Our first approach for prototyping and conversation/evaluation: Deploy the existing public dataset as a machine readable file (e.g. .csv) via IPFS/IPNS or Swarm/ENS, possibly along with a simple web front end to render the data from this file in a browser, also 'hosted' via IPFS or Swarm.

Proof of concept: (TBD - currently refactoring as a single folder to upload to IPFS)
